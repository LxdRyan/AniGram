## About
The name is a portmanteau of *Anime* and *Instagram*. This app is to have dual-functions as both an image finder and social media platform allowing users to share the images they have found (from the platform). The app will be like Instagram for Anime-style-art enjoyers.
## How
The images will be sourced from [*Danbooru*](https://danbooru.donmai.us/) through [*their api*](https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages/help:api), with search functionality implemented to allow users to find images using Danbooru's "tags". Images can then be posted onto AniGram for other users to view, share, like, etc.
## Who
The app is targeted at teenagers, especially Instagram users who enjoy anime/manga and wish to share art they like with others easily.
